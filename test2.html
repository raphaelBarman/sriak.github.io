<span class="org-level-1">* Lecture 1</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* Lecture 2</span>

For <span class="bold">*networks*</span> we use models, can't be exactly accurate (would be too complicated), but can
still be useful to understand.

<span class="custom">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* What are models for</span>
<span class="custom">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Explanation of phenomenon/behavior/pattern</span>

- Occam's razor = simplest possible model preferred
- Uses most important features of the system
- E.g. economics - income distribution

*** Prediction and inference

- Favor performance, not parsimony
- Can be black-box
- E.g. stock-price prediction for time series

** Social networks

- Captures ties between individuals
- Ties can be several things (friendship,business relationship,...)
- Tie formation:
  - Complex social process
  - Type and level of tie
- Most parsimonious model: "social network"
  - Graph
  - Undirected edges, without attributes or weights
  - Only structure
- Becoming really huge (more data)

** Information networks

- Web
- Assymetric links \Rightarrow directed graph

*** Examples

- Internet, traffic exchange arrangements (peering) w/o central coordination
- Wikipedia, references to related concepts
- Scientific literature, bibliography cites prior works
- Dictionary: explaining one term in terms of other terms

** Common features

- No rules or centralized design
- Nobody has global information (knowledge of "neighborhood" only)
- Element of chance (random models)

** Giant component

- Definition: Connected component that is:
  - Much larger than other connected components
  - Significant fraction of whole network (Same order of magnitude)
- The could be several very large components
- Finding GC:
  - Finding components: start at vertex $u$ and run BFS/DFS to exhaustion
  - Find dominant component

*** Random graphs ($G(n,p)$)

$G(n,p)$ model:
- $n$ vertices
- Every edge $(u,v)$ exists independently with prob $p$
Expected degree (# of neighbors) =  $c$ = $(n-1)p \sim np$

*** Giant component in $G(n,p)$

- Conditions for GC in $G(n,p)$
- As $n \to \infty$, what functions $p_n$ ensure that $P(G(n,p_n)$ has GC $\to
  1$
- Discovery process:
  - Start at a node $u$
  - Find $u$ 's neighbors recursively until done (BFS/DFS)
- Property of set of discovered nodes: only a function of edges and independent
  of other edges

**** Using Principle of Deferred Decision (PDD) for node discovery

Flip coin to choose next node (amongst connected and not already checked nodes)
- Three types of node:
  - Potential, could be in the component
  - Active, is in the component, edges not checked
  - saturated, in the component and edges already checked
- $k$ th step:
  - $A_k$: # active
  - $k$: # saturated (used)
  - $n-k-A_k$: # potential
- Number of new active nodes from old active node:
  - $X_k \sim \text{Binom}(n-k-A_k,p)$
  - Indep.
- Approximation: while $k$ and $A_k &lt;&lt; n$: $\text{Binom}(n-k-A_k,p) \simeq
  \text{Binom}(n,p)$
- Termination: if E[# offspring] &gt; 1; then P[termination] &lt; 1; if E[# offspring]
  &lt; 1, then P[termination] = 1

**** Condition for GC in $G(n,p)$

- Set $p=\frac{c}{n}$
  - $c$: average degree
  - Number of offspring $\sim$ Poisson($c$)
- Theorem:
  - if $c &gt; 1$, then $G(n,p)$ has a single component of size $\Theta(n)$
    asymptotically almost surely; all other components are small (of size
    $o(n)$)
  - if $c &lt; 1$, then $G(n,p)$ has only small components
- Interpretation:
  - Giant component emerges naturally, even with completely random edge
    generation
  - No network-wide &#8220;coordination&#8221; needed
  - Sharp threshold &#8211; phase transition! At avg degree c = 1
- Note:
  - More to prove: single component; impact of ignoring $k + A_k$
  - Below threshold (c &lt; 1): all small components are trees

**** $G(n,p)$ model: connectivity

- Another phase transition: Consider threshold function $t(n) = \frac{\log n}{n}$
- Theorem:
  - If $p(n)/t(n) \to \infty$, then $G(n, p)$ is connected (a.a.s.)
  - If $p(n)/t(n) \to 0$, then $G(n, p)$ is not connected (a.a.s.)
  - Gap between these two \to harder to analyze
- Intuition: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector's_problem][Coupon collector problem]]: $n \log n$ balls needed to have no empty
  bins

** Clustering

- Clustering = transitivity, two nodes with common neighbor likely to be
  connected
- Clustering coefficient = # links among friends / # possible links among
  friends = empirical probability that $(v,w)$ exists given $(u,v)$ and $(u,w)$
  exist
- If links were entirely random:
  - $c_u=p=\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \simeq \frac{2m}{n^2}$, where $m$ = # edges in
    network
  - So $c_u &gt;&gt; p$ means the network has high clustering

*** Network metrics

- Average clustering coefficient: $c_G = \frac{1}{n} \sum_u c_u$
- Weighted average clustering coefficient (also called "transitivity"):
$$c_G = \frac{\sum_u \binom{d_u}{2}c_u}{\sum_u \binom{d_u}{2}} = \frac{\text{#
closed triples}}{\text{# connected triples}} = 3 \frac{\text{#
triangles}}{\text{# connected triples}}$$

** Strong and weak ties

Now edges have propery: "Strong" = close person, "weak" = acquaintances

*** Bridges

- Bridge, removing it disconnects two components
- Local bridge, makes distance big, no more common neighbors

*** Strong Triadic Closure (STC) node property

A node a violates [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triadic_closure][STC]] if there are two strong edges $(a, b)$ and $(a, c)$, but there
is no edge $(b, c)$

*** STC \Rightarrow local bridges are weak ties

- Lemma: if a node $a$ satisfies STC (and has at least two strong ties), then
  any local bridge $(a,b)$ is weak.
- Proof:
  - Assume node a satisfies STC, but $(a, b)$ is strong and local bridge
  - By assumption, there is at least one other strong tie $(a, c)$
  - By STC, $(b, c)$ must exist
  - But then $a$ and $b$ have common neighbor $c$, so $(a, b)$ is not a local bridge
  - Contradiction
- Insight: Social ties to communities usually go through weak links

** Short paths

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment][Milgram 1969]]
- Theorem: $G(n,p)$ has diameter $\log(n) / \log(np)$
- Intuition:
  - Graph looke close to a tree from every node
  - Randomness creates very "efficient" graphs (edges used very well to reach
    large number of nodes + few short cycle, incl. triangles)

*** Evolution of average distance with shortcuts

- Average distance on a circle: $cn$, where $c$ is a constant
- Average distance with one "ideal" shortcut $cn/2$
- With $k$ shortcuts $O(\frac{n}{2^k})$
- Distance drops quickly with $k$

*** Evolution of clustering coeff with shortcuts

- As long as $k &lt;&lt; n$, small impact on clustering coefficient, few triangles get
  destroyed

*** Small worlds

- high clustering
- small distances

<span class="org-level-1">* Lecture 3</span>
<span class="custom">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Herding and "watching thy neighbor"</span>

- Information cascades: why imitating your friends makes sense &#8211; and how it can lead to surprising group behavior
- Heavy-tailed degree distributions: &#8220;the rich get richer&#8221; applied to networks

<span class="custom">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Watching thy Neighbor</span>

- Human decision-making:
  - Primary private information...
  - Heavily influenced by what decisions taken by others
- Reason:
  - Primary information: often too voluminous, noisy, not trustworthy,...
  - By imitating others, piggyback on their effort to interpret primary information
- Question: Macro behavior of such systems?

** Herding how it can go wrong? Urn model

- Urn with 3 balls
  - A priori distribution (blue/red majority) = (0.5,0.5)
  - majority blue: 2 blue + 1 red
  - majority red: 2 red + 1 blue
- A group of people take turns:
  - Draw a ball from the urn at random
  - Check the color of the ball privately, put it back in urn
  - Announce their guess (blue/red majority) to everybody
- Assumption:
  1. Each individual is altruistic: do what allows others to make best guess
  2. Each individual is selfish = tries to make best guess for himself

*** Urn model: altruistic

- Every person:
  - Selects a ball at random (with replacement)
  - Announces the color of the ball to everybody
- As $n \to \infty$, majority color of urn is equal to color most frequently observed
  - Consequence of law of large numbers
- After a few &#8220;sacrifices&#8221;, everybody could produce best guess
  - Sacrifice in the sense that first few individuals might be forced to say red
    (color of their ball) even if previous information suggests blue majority

*** Urn model: selfish

- Sequential decision-making
  - Public guess &#8211; goal: correct guess for many/most people
  - Observed color remains private
- First individual:
  - Blue ball: announce guess(1) = blue
  - Red ball: announce guess(1) = red
  - Public guess of first fully reveals private information
- Second individual:
  - If color(2) = guess(1): announce this color
  - If color(2) &#8800; guess(1): does not matter (assume color(2))
  - Public guess of second fully reveals private information
- Third individual:
  - if guess(1) &#8800; guess(2): announce guess(3) = color(3)
  - If guess(1) = guess(2): Announce guess(3)=guess(2)=guess(1), regardless of color(3)
  - Why is this?
    - Person 3 knows that guesses 1+2 reveal perfect information
    - Therefore, regardless of color(3), guess(1)=guess(2) dominates guess
- Fourth,...,&#8734;th individual:
  - If guess(1) = guess(2): Announce guess(i) = guess(2)=guess(1), regardless of
    color(i)
This model leads to cascade
- If guess(1) = guess(2) were both wrong, then all future guesses are wrong!
- This happens with prob. 1/9
- Even though each individual is using available information in the best way to make a guess
- Can show that in this model, this is sure to happen eventually (even if not
  for 3 rd individual)

*** Information cascade: suboptimal decision

- Cascade: sequential decisions
- Individual:
  - Efficiency gain by observing others&#8217; decisions
- Global behavior:
  - Primary information can &#8220;wash out&#8221;
  - Suboptimal or random decisions
- Might these be cascades:
  - Stock market gyrations, &#8220;flash crash&#8221;
  - Inexplicable shifts in popularity of {restaurants, clubs, celebrities,...}
  - Fashion, style, celebrity,...
  - ...

** Herding in networks

- Observation: degree distributions in networks often resemble power laws
- Power law: $P(D &gt; d) \propto d^{-\gamma}$
- Must distributions have "light tails": eg. $P(D &gt; d) \propto e^{0\alpha d}$
Example of such distribution: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution][Pareto distribution]] 

Useful to compare the tail of the distribution, what is d* s.t P(D &gt; d*) = 10^-9

** Preferential attachment in growing nets

- Growth model: nodes arrive one by one and join the existing network
  - Directed graph
  - In-degree $d_{in{(v)$ measures "popularity" and attractiveness" of node
- Preferential attachment: new node creates one edge
- Prob. of connecting to $v$ is $\propto d_{in}(v)$
- Intuition: high-degree easier to meet; more popular; more useful;...
- Node with in-degree 0 never gets &#8220;started&#8221;
- Need another assumption:
  - With prob. $\alpha$, new node connects uniformly at random
  - With prob. $1 - \alpha$ , preferential attachment

*** Analysis

cf. slides for details.

** Observing
*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox][Friendship Paradox]]

- &#8220;Your friends have more friends than you&#8221;
- Social network = $G(V,E)$
- $d_v$ : degree of node $v$
- $n = |V|$ : number of nodes, $m = |E|$ : number of edges
- Average number of friends: $\mu = \frac{\sum d_v}{n}$
- How to talk about average number of friends&#8217; friends?
  - Average degree over nodes: $\mu = \frac{\sum d_v}{n} = 2 \frac{m}{n}$, look at each person
  - Average degree over edges: $\frac{\sum_{(u,v)\in E} d_v}{2m}$, look at each person's list of friends
- Lemma:
  - $\frac{\sum_{(u,v)\in E} d_v}{2m} = \mu\left(1+\frac{\sigma^2}{\mu^2}\right)$
  - Degree variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{v\in V} d^2_v - \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{v\in V} d_v\right)^2$

*** Observer matters

Sampling bias

<span class="org-level-1">* Lecture 4</span>
<span class="custom">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Node statistics in large networks</span>

- Breadth-First Search
  - Problem: &#8220;locality bias&#8221;
  - E.g.: starting node is a page in English \to most nearby pages probably are as well
- Depth-First Search
  - Advantage: avoid locality bias
  - Problem: bias in ordering of links
  - E.g.: suppose FB friends listed alphabetically -&gt; only visit people named
    &#8220;A*"
- Node sampling
  - Urn model: select every node with prob. 1/n indep. with replacement; compute
    average over many samples
  - Problem: usually not available, because we only have &#8220;neighbors of current
    node&#8221;!

<span class="custom">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Random walks on graphs</span>

- Random Walk
  - Advantage: no ordering bias (by def); no locality bias (under some conditions)
  - A bit like DFS with shuffled neighbors (but RW can return)
- Undirected graph $G(V,E)$
- Assume connected (otherwise assume G is the GC for the actual network)
  - Random Walk:
    + Discrete time $t$
    + Node at time $t$: $X_t$
    + At each time step, go to a neighbor of $X_t$ uniformly at random \to
      $X_{t+1}$
Problem, bias: high-degree nodes sampled more frequently

<span class="custom">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Random walks as Markov chain</span>

- Transition matrix $P$:
$$P= \begin{cases}
p_{ij} = 1/d_i &amp; (i,j) \in E\\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
- If $G(V, E)$ is undirected, connected and non-bipartite, then $\lbrace X_t
  \rbrace$ is an ergodic (irreducible, aperiodic) Markov chain
(Ergodicity: Stationary distribution $\pi$, $p_{ij}(t) \to \pi_j$

<span class="custom">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Stationary distribution \pi</span>

- Lemma: $\pi \propto [d_1 , d_2 , \dots , d_n ]$
- Proof:
  - Def of stationary distribution: $\pi = \pi P$
  - [d_1 , d_2 , d_3 , \dots , d_n] P = x
  - $x_j = \sum_i d_i p_{ij} = \sum_i 1_{\lbrace(i,j) \in E \rbrace} = d_j$
  - $[d_1 , \dots , d_n]$ is eigenvector with eigenvalue=1 \to stationary distribution
Intuition:
- Random walk &#8220;sees&#8221; uniformly random edges; nodes biased by # of edges = degree
- Similar to Friendship Paradox!

<span class="custom">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Obtaining unbiased estimator from RW</span>

- Node statistic $f(i)$
- Would like to know $F = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{v\in V} f(v)$
- Sampling:
  - Ideal: $P(X_t = v) = \frac{1}{n}$
  - RW: $P(X_t = v) = \frac{d_v}{||d||_1} = \frac{d_v}{2m}$
- Compensate for degree bias:
  - Let RW run for $T$ time steps
  - Compute $\hat{F} = \frac{2m \sum_t f(X_t)/d_{X_t}}{nT}$
- Stationary regime: unbiased $E[\hat{F}] = E[f(X_t)] = F$, but we cannot start
  in stationary regime, instead at a specific state \to how large does $T$ have
  to be?

*** Estimator without knowledge of $n,m$

- In practice, we may not know $n, m$
- Eliminate from estimate:
  - Can estimate normalization constant from sample path
  - $\hat{F} = \frac{\sum_t f(X_t)/d_{X_t}}{\sum_t 1/d_{X_t}}$
  - Denominator: sum of all (random) weights

*** Spectral theorem applied to RW

- Want to compute powers of $P$: $p_{ij}(t) = [P^t]_{ij}$: $P$(at $j$ after $t$
  steps|starting at $i$)
- Spectral decomposition: But P is not symmetric
- Work with a &#8220;symmetrized&#8221; version of P
  - Def: D =diag(\frac{1}{d_1},\dots, \frac{1}{d_n})
  - Def: A = adjacency matrix
  - N = D1/2 AD1/2 = D &#8722;1/2 PD1/2
  - Symmetric \to spectral form: $N = \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k v_k v_k^T$
  - $\lambda k$ : eigenvalues
  - $v_k$ : normalized eigenvectors
- $p_{ij}(t) = [P^t]_{ij} = \pi_j + \sum_{k=2}^n \lambda_k^t \nu_{ki}\nu_{kj}
  \sqrt{\frac{d_j}{d_i}}$

One dominant giant strongly connected component.
<span class="custom">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Search \to Ranking</span>
- Search query \to ranked list of results
- Two ingredients:
  - Relevance score: how relevant is the result to the query (cf retrieval lectures)
  - Importance score: quality, importance of the result independent of query
<span class="custom">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Hyperlink: intuition</span>
Links are asymmetric
- Existence under control of link tail
  - Means &#8220;X considers Y relevant&#8221;
  - Does not necessarily mean &#8220;quality&#8221; or &#8220;agreement&#8221;
- Represented as directed graph
<span class="custom">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Turning hyperlink net into ranking</span>
- Importance score of page $u:$ $\pi_u$
- Approach 1: $\pi_u = i_u$ (in-degree)
  - More endorsements = more important
  - Problem: easy to spam (e.g., link-farm)
- Approach 2: take into account importance of endorser \to circular
  - $\pi = \sum_{(v,u)}\pi_v$
  - More important endorsers = more important
  - Problem: a page pointing to a single other page should be stronger endorsement
    than e.g. a long list of links
Approach 3:
$$\pi_u = \sum_{(v,u)} \frac{\pi_v}{o_v}$$
<span class="custom">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Score-flow matrix $H$</span>
- Def: $H_{uv} = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{o_u} &amp; (u,v) \in E \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$
- Note: $H$ is the transition matrix of a RW on the web
  - "Random surfer": $P(\text{at }v\text{ at time }t+1) = \sum_u P(\text{at
    }u\text{ at time }t)/o_u$
  - $\pi_{t+1} = \pi_t H$
- If RW is ergodic, then $\pi_t \to \pi$
  - $\pi = \pi H$, i.e., solves the score-flow equation
  - Condition for ergodicity: graph has to be non-periodic and strongly connected
    \to aperiodic and irreducible Markov chain
<span class="custom">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Dangling nodes</span>
Dangling node = absorbing state of RW (not strongly connected)

\Rightarrow There is no (non-zero) $\pi$ that solves $\pi = \pi H$
<span class="custom">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Dealing with dangling nodes</span>
- Idea: if random surfer arrives at dangling node \to go to any webpage uniformly at random
  - Or following some well-chosen distribution a over all nodes
- Def: $w=$indicator of dangling nodes, Example: $w = (0,0,0,1)$
- $\hat{H} = H +\frac{1}{n} (w^T e)$ (stochastic matrix)
<span class="custom">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Google Matrix $G$</span>
Can have sets that forms absorbing class or can have several solutions.
<span class="custom">***</span><span class="org-level-4">* Solution</span>
Add randomization: at every iteration, coin flip: with prob $\theta$ walk on the
graph $\hat{H}$, with prob. $1-\theta$ jump to a random page.
- $G = \theta \hat{H} = (1-\theta) \frac{e^T e}{n}$, where $e^T e/n$ is called
  the teleportation matrix
- Theorem:
  - if $\theta &lt; 1$, $\pi = \pi G$ has exactly one solution for any network
    graph
  - if $\theta = 0$, then $\pi$ uniform
  - In practice: $0.8 \le \theta \le 0.9$
  - Prob of jumping = geometric
- PageRank algoithm computes this solution
