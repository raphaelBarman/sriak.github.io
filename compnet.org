** Definitions
*** Network
A network is made of
- end-systems (server or client)
- Internet Service Provider (ISP)
- Links
- Switches
*** Acess network
**** Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
- Uses *existing* telephone line
- *Dedicated* line
**** Cable network
- *Shared* line
**** Enterprise acess networks (ethernet)
- Used by companies/universities
- Instituional link to ISP
- Use of ethernet switches
**** Wireless networks
- Local or wide-area (cellular networks)
*** Protocol
A protocol defines format, order of messages sent and received among network
entities and actions taken on message transmisson/receiption.
*** Packets
- Host divides what he want to send into chunks called *packets* of length $L$
- transmit packet into network at *transmission rate* $R$
*** Routing
Determines source-destination route taken by packets \rightarrow /routing algorithms/
*** Forwading
Move packets from router's input to appropriate router output
*** Switch contents
- Buffers \rightarrow store data
- Forwading table
  - Store meta-data
  - Indicate where to send the data
*** Throughput
Rate (bps) at which bits are transferred between sender/receiver. Depends on the
*bottleneck* link (slowest link). Meaning that the average throughput is equal
to the minimum link bandwith of network.
** Concepts
*** Circuit vs packet switching
| Circuit-switching                                        | Packet-switching                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| resources reserved per active connection                 | Packets treated on demand                             |
| admission control & forwarding decision : per connection | admission control & forwarding decision : per packet  |
| inefficient resource user                                | efficient ressource use                               |
| predictable performance                                  | unpredictable performance                             |
|                                                          | simpler to implement, but requires congestion control |
|                                                          | allow more user to use the network                    |
**** Circuit-switching
- End to end resources reserved for "call" between source and destination
- No sharing : circuit-like (guaranteed) performance
- Twos implemation :
  - Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
    - Divides time in *time slot*
    - separate time slot per connection (burst at full speed)
  - Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
    - Divide frequency spectrum in *frequency bands*
    - separate frequency band per connection
**** Packet-switching
- Hosts break application-layer messages into packer
  - Forward packets from one routeur to the next, across links on path from
    source to destination
  - Each packet transmitted at *full link capacity*
- *Store and forward* : entire packet must arriver at routeur before it can be
  transmitted on next link
- If arrival rate (bits) to link > transmission rate of link :
  - packet will *queue*, waiting to be transmitted
  - packets can be *dropped* (lost) if buffer fills up
*** Internet organization

*** Delay
We have that :

d_{nodal} = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{trans} + d_{prop}

- d_{trans} : transmission delay
  - Time needed to push all the bits of a packet into a link
  - L: packet length (bits)
  - R: link bandwidth (bps)
  - d_{trans} = L/R
- d_{prop}: propagation delay
  - Time needed to move one bit from one end of a link to the other
  - d: length of physical link
  - s: propagation speed in medium
  - d_{prop} = d/s
- d_{proc}: nodal processing
  - check bit errors
  - determine output link
  - typically < msec
- d_{queue} : queuing delay
  - time waiting at output link for transmission
  - depends on congestion level of routeur (and burstiness of arrival)
  - statistical mesure
  - Way to analyse :
    - units :
      - L: packet length (bits)
      - R: link bandwidth (bps)
      - a: average packet arrival rate
    - analysis :
      - La/R ~ 0 : average queuing delay *small*
      - La/R ~ 1 : average queuing delay *large*
      - La/R > 1 : more "work" arriving than can be serviced, average queuing
        delay *infinite*
*** Internet  layering
- application : application that exchange *messages*
- transport : transports *segments* between two apps
- network : move *datagrams* around the network
- link : moves *frames* across a link
- physical : moves data across a physical medium

Advantages :
- reduce complexity
- improve flexibility
*** Security
Different ways of attacking :
- Malware
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Packet sniffing (eavesdropping)
- Ip spoofing (impersonating)
